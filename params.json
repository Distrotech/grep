All\r\nbugs reported in previous releases have been fixed.  Many exciting new\r\nbugs have probably been introduced in this revision.\r\n\r\nGNU grep is provided \"as is\" with no warranty.  The exact terms\r\nunder which you may use and (re)distribute this program are detailed\r\nin the GNU General Public License, in the file COPYING.\r\n\r\nGNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about\r\ntwice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper\r\nsearch for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being\r\nconsidered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to\r\nlook at every character.  The result is typically many times faster\r\nthan Unix grep or egrep.  (Regular expressions containing backreferencing\r\nwill run more slowly, however.)\r\n\r\nSee the files AUTHORS and THANKS for a list of authors and other contributors.\r\n\r\nSee the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.\r\n\r\nSee the file NEWS for a description of major changes in this release.\r\n\r\nSee the file TODO for ideas on how you could help us improve grep.\r\n\r\nSee the file README-alpha for information on grep development and the CVS\r\n  repository.\r\n\r\nSend bug reports to bug-grep@gnu.org.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n\r\nSeveral tests in fmbtest.sh and foad1.sh fail under the cs_CZ.UTF-8 locale\r\nand have been disabled.\r\n\r\nThe combination of -o and -i options is broken and the known failing cases\r\nare disabled in foad1.sh\r\n\r\nThe option -i does not work properly in some multibyte locales such as\r\ntr_TR.UTF-8 where the upper case and lower case forms of a character are not\r\nnecessarily of the same byte length.\r\n\r\nAdditional bug reports can be found at:\r\n\r\n        http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=grep\r\n\r\nYou can also browse the bug-grep mailing list archive at:\r\n\r\n        http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grep/\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
